    <p>My name is Alice Chambers, i am currently a first year student studying Software Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University. I have been interested in computers and advances in technology for most of my life, dipping in and out of learning about networks and other aspects of computing.<br><br> When i was 16, I started to learn how to code Python by completing a short course in a college. After a few years of persuing my other great interest in Biology and Chemistry, i realised it was not my prefereed career choice and i decided to try out something more creative</p>

  <div class="column">
    <p>I volunteered at a grassroots digital media company to help spark my interest in computing again, and i was able to try out the new VR technology (at the time) such as the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive.<br><br>
          After a few months, i started an apprentiship as a Marketing Assistant for an SaaS company, MED e-care.<br><br> After helping the development team to create a new user interface for the welcome page of the software, i was interested in the way the rest of the software works. I decided i was bored of marketing and wanted to take on a new challenge, so i started this course at Sheffield Hallam!</p>
